# Self-Directed Front-End Start Kit

## Initial Setup

1. Clone this starter kit repository and rename the repository to anything you'd like in one command:

  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:turingschool-projects/self-directed-fe-starter.git <name of your choice>
  ```
2. Change into the new director directory.

3. Remove the default remote (origin):

  ```shell
  git remote rm origin
  ```

4. Create a new repository on GitHub.

5. Add your new repository remote - **your remote URL and user name will be different in the command below**

  ```shell
  git remote add origin git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB NAME>/<PROJECT NAME>.git
  ```

6. Install the dependencies of the starter kit:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

7. Add, commit, and push up to your repository:

  ```shell
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit using starter kit"
  git push origin master
  ```

## Running the Server Locally

To see your code in action locally, you need to fire up a development server. Use the command:

```shell
npm start
```

Once the server is running, visit in your browser:

* `http://localhost:8080/` to run your application.
